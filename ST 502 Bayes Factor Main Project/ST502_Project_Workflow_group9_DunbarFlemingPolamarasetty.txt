######ST502 Group9 Project Workflow######
#For group members Jonathon Fleming, Cole Dunbar, Tharun Polamarasetty

#All code was run using R-3.6.3 and was tested in a windows 10 command prompt
#Before running  must install the following packages using the following commands:
	#install.packages(pkgs = c("plyr", "MCMCpack", "R.utils", "ggplot2", "MBESS", "tidyverse", "ggthemes", "BayesFactor", "devtools", "gridExtra"), repos="http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/")
	#library("devtools") 
	#devtools::install_github("neurotroph/ReplicationBF")

#####Start of Workflow#####
#The following commands were tested in windows 10 command prompt

	RScript "location\run_file.R" arg[1]   #(arg[1] is location to output simulation results)  
	RScript "location\run_file.R" arg[1]   #(arg[1] is location of output from previous command (should be the same))


#####End of Workflow#####

###Example:
	Rscript "C:\Users\name\downloads\run_file.R" "C:\\Users\\name\\desktop"
	Rscript "C:\Users\name\downloads\out_file.R" "C:\\Users\\name\\desktop"

		### Note the use of \\ in the argument. 

###run_file will output four rds files to the location specified as arg[1] called:
	#BFrep_Sim1.rds
	#BFrep_Sim3.rds
	#BFrep_Ex3.rds
	#BFrep_Ex3data.rds

###out_file will load in the four rds files and output the following four pdf files to the location specified by arg[1]:
	#Group_9_Figure_1.pdf
	#Group_9_Figure_2.pdf
	#Group_9_Figure_3.pdf
	#Group_9_Table_1.pdf
