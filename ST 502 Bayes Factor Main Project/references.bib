Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 143(6) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: General (see record [rid]2014-49316-003[/rid]). Three errors occurred in the Examples section. The errors are corrected in the erratum, and a more detailed description of the errata can be found on http://dx.doi.org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/10.1037/a0038326.supp] Replication attempts are essential to the empirical sciences. Successful replication attempts increase researchers’ confidence in the presence of an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of 2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that postulates a zero effect size, H₀ : δ = 0. The 2nd hypothesis is that of the prop},

Abstract = {Statistical Power Analysis is a nontechnical guide to power analysis in research planning that provides users of applied statistics with the tools they need for more effective analysis. The Second Edition includes: • a chapter covering power analysis in set correlation and multivariate methods; • a chapter considering effect size, psychometric reliability, and the efficacy of'qualifying'dependent variables and; • expanded power and sample size tables for multiple regression/correlation.},
